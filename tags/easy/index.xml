      <description>ScriptKiddie Contents  Write Up Recon Credentials Notes  Write Up Initial scan showed two open ports, 22 and 5000. 5000 hosts a web server, so we&amp;rsquo;ll start there. We&amp;rsquo;re greeted with a page titled &amp;ldquo;k1d&#39;5 h4ck3r t00l5&amp;rdquo;, which looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll run certain shell commands with user supplied input. Among the commands are nmap, msfvenom, and searchsploit. Tacking on commands with &amp;amp; doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, neither does using single or double quotes to escape.</description>

      <description>Delivery Contents  Write Up Recon Credentials Notes  Write Up First scans show two open ports, 22 and 80. Opening up the address in a web browser brings us to a welcome page with a link to a helpdesk subdomain(http://helpdesk.delivery.htb/) and a &amp;ldquo;Contact Us&amp;rdquo; button. To access this subdomain, I added it to my hosts file with the box&amp;rsquo;s ip.
The subdomain takes us to a support ticketing portal powered by OSTicket.</description>

      <description>Admirer 10.10.10.187 Write-Up Recon with NMAP shows three ports. 21, 22, 80. No progress on the first two. The apache service on 80 displays a gallery website with no useful links. Robots.txt reveals /admin-dir, but we do not have permission to view it. Fuzzing /admin-dir/ revealed contacts.txt, which contains some admin and developer e-mails, and credentials.txt, which has creds for an FTP, Wordpress, and internal mail account. Connecting to the FTP server gives us an SQL dump and backup of the site files.</description>

      <description>Blunder 10.10.10.191 by SixPraxis
Write-Up Initial recon shows one open port running an HTML service. Inspection reveals a blog running on Bludit CMS v3.9.2. Known exploits for this platform include an authentication brute force mitigation bypass and an authenticated code execution. Fuzzing found a todo.txt, which has the name fergus in it. After creating a brute force script and making no progress, we notice that in the Stephen King blog post there is a name that is oddly unspaced.</description>

      <description>Buff 10.10.10.198 by SixPraxis Write-Up Nmap scans showed 2 open ports, 7680 running an unidentified service and 8080 running a gym website. The about page on the website displayed &amp;ldquo;Made using Gym Management Software 1.0&amp;rdquo;. An RCE vulnerability is present in the software and an exploit is publicly available. A pre-made exploit was downloaded from exploit db, number 48506. After fixing the code in the exploit, it was used to upload a web shell interface to the site.</description>

      <description>Omni 10.10.10.204 by SixPraxis Write-Up Pulling up port 8080 in a web browser asks for a login for &amp;ldquo;Windows Device Portal&amp;rdquo;. After looking at the ports and doing some research it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that the machine is running Windows IoT core. An exploit called SirepRAT exists for this that lets an attacker remotely execute commands. After cloning the script from git hub, python2 SirepRAT.py 10.10.10.204 GetFileInformationFromDevice --remote_path &amp;quot;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe&amp;quot; was issued to confirm the existence of the powershell executable.</description>

      <description>Tabby 10.10.10.194 by SixPraxis Write-Up Initial nmap scans revealed three ports, two of which were running HTTP services, the other being SSH. A server rental website resided on port 80 and Apache Tomcat 9 on port 8080. Investigating the site on port 80 revealed that news.php contained an LFI vulnerability. Tests successfully accessed /etc/passwd by requesting http://target.htb/news.php?file=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd. No further vulnerabilities were found on port 80.
Port 8080 displayed the default page for Tomcat, listing internal paths to configuration files and links to the manager web interfaces used to manage the installation.</description>
